*OVERVIEW*

One of the most common scenarios not supported directly with amendments is the ability to combine multiple contracts onto into a single contract and EXTEND that contract beyond the original term. From a functionality perspective, this is known as *Cancel & Replace*, as the original contracts are cancelled with negative orders and a new quote is created for the customer going forward.

The Cancel & Replace framework is designed to provide a *pattern* for advanced contract manipulation via customization. While you may choose to install the managed package from the app exchange, the full codebase will be released as open source software available on Github.
